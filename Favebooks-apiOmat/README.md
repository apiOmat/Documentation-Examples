This is the finished customized project for using the apiOmat backend instead of an SQLite database as storage.

You can find a step by step guide on what was changed here: http://www.apiomat.com/docs/tutorials/titanium-quickstart/

**To import from the file system**:

1. Clone the Documentation-Samples GitHub repository or [download the ZIP](https://github.com/apiOmat/Documentation-Examples/archive/master.zip).
2. Select **File > Import...**.
3. In the Import dialog select **Existing Mobile Project** from the Titanium (or Studio) folder and click **Next**.
4. Browse to folder containing the project and click Finish.

To get the app running, you only need to set up the backend accordingly, copy the SDK into the project (/app/lib) and use your account credentials. All as explained in the [Quickstart](http://www.apiomat.com/docs/tutorials/titanium-quickstart/).
